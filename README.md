# Dash application for TRAP 

TRAP is developed for making a robust prediction of CD8+ T-cell epitope from MHC-I ligands. 
It uses deep learning-based model for immunogenicity prediction and DecisionTree classifier to estimate the degree of correctness. 

The users can use gbm_test_data.csv as an example input data to the model.
